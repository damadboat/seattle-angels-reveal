"Content marketing is one of the best methods for businesses to generate leads and close sales. Businesses are producing more and more content to meet customer demand, but don't have the infrastructure to efficiently produce content. It's Slope's mission to provide a solution that allows businesses to easily work with their team to create and manage their media content.

Slope is a cloud platform for collecting, storing, accessing, and collaborating on professional media content. By using this platform, businesses can save time and money through more efficient workflow on their marketing initiatives.
Slope is the smartest way for marketing teams to collaborate on visual content. Businesses are producing more visual content than ever before, but still lack the tools to make it efficient.

We also provide teams with meaningful data to help them improve their process, and better correlate the effort of creating content with its effectiveness in the market.
